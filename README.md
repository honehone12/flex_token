what if the design of tokens or coins are customizable?  
it can be fun! 

customizable tokens can be achieved with move object model.  
https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/move-examples/token_objects/sources/hero.move  

an interesting effect of customizable tokens may be that price can be devided into
market-price like current distributed NFTs and fixed-price.  
this can mean who are really worring about risk of market price can also
join as a crator of "parts of token".
